# Applesoft BASIC Syntax for Sublime Text 3

First stab at a Sublime Text 3 syntax definition for the Applesoft BASIC programming language. Applesoft BASIC was a dialect of Microsoft BASIC written in the late 1970s and shipped with Apple's 8-bit personal computers. 

The syntax definition in this repository is based on Joshua Bell's implementation of Applesoft BASIC in Javascript.
